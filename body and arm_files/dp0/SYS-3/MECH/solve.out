   10800 CONTACT ELEMENTS &    4752 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.

 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 2442, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 3345 elements    
 for the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs   
 are being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                  

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 7 and contact element type 6 has been set up.  The         
 companion pair has real constant set ID 6.  Both pairs should have the  
 same behavior.                                                          
 MAPDL will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Pure thermal contact is activated.
 The emissivity is defined through the material property.
 Thermal convection coefficient, environment temperature, and
  heat flux are defined using the SFE command.
 Target temperature is used for convection/radiation calculation
  for near field contact.
 Linear contact is defined

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
