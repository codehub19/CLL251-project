 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 8 and contact element type 7 has been set up.  The

 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver
