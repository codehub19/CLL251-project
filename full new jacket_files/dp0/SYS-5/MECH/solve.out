 The Solution Control Option is only valid for single field structural,  
 single field thermal, single field diffusion, coupled                   
 thermal-diffusion analyses and coupled-field analyses with structural   
 degrees of freedom.  The SOLCONTROL,ON command (if present) has been

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.141   TIME= 12:57:02
 Contact element 3416 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of       
 underlying base element 193.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,   
 but checking for this is discontinued.                                  

     336 CONTACT ELEMENTS &     415 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
       7 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       0.141   TIME= 12:57:02
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 75, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 153 elements for   
 the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs are   
 being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                      

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 The coupled-field analysis is weakly coupled and requires at least two  
 iterations to achieve a coupled response.  Please check the results     
 carefully.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
