 CHECK INITIAL OPEN/CLOSED STATUS OF SELECTED CONTACT ELEMENTS
      AND LIST DETAILED CONTACT PAIR INFORMATION

     252 CONTACT ELEMENTS &     280 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
       4 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       0.266   TIME= 12:03:12
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 70, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 249 elements for   
 the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs are   
 being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                      

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 6 and contact element type 6 has been set up.  The

 same behavior.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
